  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish consisting of layers of flat pasta sheets alternated with various fillings, sauces, and cheeses, then baked to perfection. Traditionally, the layers include a rich meat-based sauce (ragù), a creamy béchamel sauce, and cheeses like mozzarella and Parmesan. Variations might use ricotta cheese, vegetables, or alternative protein sources.</p>
  <p>The pasta sheets are typically boiled or oven-ready and provide structure to the dish, while the sauces add moisture and flavor. Once assembled in a casserole dish, lasagna is baked until the top is golden and bubbly, with slightly crispy edges. It is hearty, flavorful, and often served as a main course for family meals or special occasions.</p>
